<img src="twitter pictureee.PNG" alt="Data collected from twitter in order to create a word cloud." style="width:600px;height:300px;" class="center">
<p>This was a project that we did when we were looking at the data of twitter. We did this project when we were focusing on python. Dictionary and JSON were a big part of this process. I was so shocked to see a word cloud of all the different words that are used in tweets.</p>
